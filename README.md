runit-init-scripts
==================

Collection of init scripts for runit (inspiration from Gentoo openrc2 init scripts)


Notes
-----

*   Clone the repository in /var/service.
    There are hardcoded directories (/var/service), I think most of them is about the location of `schema.yml` and `runit_helper.py`.


Requirements
------------

*   PyYaml
*   python-dateutil
